          Angelina was wonderful and did a terrific job. We both thoroughly enjoyed the trip as did Janet and Adrian -
          mostly due to Angelina. She was a delight. I canâ€™t tell you how excited we are to be coming back to Italy and
          to be seeing you again. It was always our dream that we would come back one day and have you share your beautiful
          country with us.
