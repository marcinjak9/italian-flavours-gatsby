      In a fun and interactive cooking demonstration I will make the most
      traditional Italian recipes for you and your guests, using the best
      Italian gourmet products, such as truffles, excellent extra-virgin olive
      oil, handmade pasta and much more. A charming dinner will follow, where we
      will talk about Italy and Italian traditions, whilst enjoying my personal
      selection of delicious Italian wines.

Are you dreaming about bringing back home the charming atmosphere you enjoyed during our tour together or during your fabulous holiday in Italy?

Are you missing the authentic smells of that delicious wine or the unique flavours of those truffle crostini you tasted in that hidden trattoria in Tuscany?

I can definitely help you satisfy your nostalgic longing for Italy.

I also go on tour abroad and when I do, I love bringing the real soul, flavours and perfumes of Italy directly to my guests houses, wherever they are in the world.

**During all the events I will hold a special class dedicated to the “Italian gourmet etiquette” and a speech about Italian culture and the most antique wine and food traditions in Italy, this is the Angelina’s Italian Gourmet School.**
