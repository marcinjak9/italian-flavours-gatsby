Are you dreaming about bringing back home the charming atmosphere you enjoyed during our tour together or during your fabulous holiday in Italy?



Are you missing the authentic smells of that delicious wine or the unique flavours of those truffle crostini you tasted in that typical, hidden trattoria in Tuscany?



I can definitely help you relieving your nostalgia for Italy…awaiting for your next gourmet experience, of course!



I also go on tour abroad and when I do, I love bringing the real soul, flavours and perfumes of Italy directly to my guests houses, wherever they are in the world.



**During all the events I will hold a special class dedicated to the “Italian gourmet etiquette” and a speech about Italian culture and the most antique wine and food traditions in Italy, this is the Angelina’s Italian Gourmet School.**
