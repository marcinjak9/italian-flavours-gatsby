  subtitle: The "Island magic" in a unique culinary adventure
tourDescription:
  body: >
    Sicily is the largest of the Italian islands, separated from the Continent
    by the Strait of Messina and surrounded by the Ionian, the Tyrrhenian and
    the Mediterranean Seas. It is one of the pearls of Southern Italy and can be
    discovered, understood and experienced through a series of itineraries
    dedicated to areas of interest ranging from nature to history and
    traditions. Nature seems to have endowed all its wonders to this land:
    mountains, hills and above all the sea, with its incredible colors, its
    crystal-clear water and the beauty of its seabeds, in no way inferior to
    those of other seas. 


    Here, the Mediterranean Sea, with its many little islands scattered around
    the coasts of Sicily - The Aeolians, Egadi and Pelagie Islands, Pantelleria
    and Ustica - offers unique and the intense sceneries, scents and flavors of
    uncontaminated nature. And last but not least, its great volcanoes are
    symbols of the irresistible beauty and vitality of this incredibly charming
    region.


    Together we will enjoy all the beauty this region has to offer, as the
    archeological area of Agrigento, one of the most important towns of Magna
    Graecia. The famous Valley of the Temples - surrounded by green olive
    groves, almond trees, citrus orchards and vineyards that stretch out to the
    sea with all its imposing and elegant monuments - fantastically evokes an
    atmosphere of 2500 years ago, when the ancient Akagras Agrigentum was a
    center of power and learning, and of coruse the stunning UNESCO World
    Heritage Sites of Syracuse area, the must-sees Late Baroque cities of the
    Noto Valley, 


    And what about Taormina? This small village is only a landscape, yet a
    landscape where you can find everything to seduce your eyes, your spirit,
    your imagination." This is how the famous French writer Guy de Maupassant
    described Taormina, hitting on the essence of this little jewel midway
    between Messina and Catania. 

    But Sicily is muc, much more, the exuberance and warmth of the island of
    Sicily is evident in its food as well, which tells of Sicilians' passion and
    care for good food and genuine flavors and no one should not pass up the
    famous Sicilian pastries, mainly prepared with ricotta cheese and almond
    paste. 

    Many Sicilian products are protected by DOP and IGT quality marks, making
    Sicily one of the  core diets of Mediterranean; it is famous the world over
    for the genuineness of its ingredients. 


    Extra-virgin olive oil, juicy red oranges and the sweet grapes of Canicattì,
    Pachino tomatoes and Pantelleria capers, prickly pears and the olives of
    Nocellara del Belice are some of the excellent products that distinguish
    Sicilian food.
     Yet, we cannot forget the most famous cheeses, like Ragusano and pecorino, or tasty sausages, like Sant’Angelo salami, or the different types of crispy bread, like the loaves of Dittaino, of course everything accompanied by a glass of one of the island's exquisite, strong and full-bodied wines, ideal when partnered with its unbeatable cuisine. 

    Ready for an unforgettable tour in this enchanting region? It will be a joy
    for me sharing all of this and even more with you.
