    I graduated in Italian Literature and I attained a Master degree in Gourmet
    and Quality Food at the renowned University of Florence, where I had the
    chance to deepen my knowledge about the history of Italian gourmet culture
    products. 


    I collaborated with the Tourist Board of Oristano, where I live and I worked
    as a senior quality consultant for 10 years. After many years working in the
    field, I decided to put these experiences to use and I founded my first own
    company, Sardinia Flavour, which aim was to make people all over the world
    know and taste the most precious and traditional delicacies from Italy.

    che ci accompagneranno in questo tour. E, perché no, anche la musicalità
    dell'italiano.
