    'San Gimignano delle belle Torri' is 56 km south of Florence (Tuscany) and
    it is indisputably one of the most iconic and recognisable destinations in
    Tuscany. It served as an important relay point for pilgrims travelling to or
    from Rome on the Via Francigena. The patrician families who controlled the
    town built around 72 tower-houses (some as high as 50 m) as symbols of their
    wealth and power. Although only 14 have survived, San Gimignano has retained
    its feudal atmosphere and appearance. The town also has several masterpieces
    of 14th- and 15th-century Italian art.


    The town became independent in 1199 and between the 11th and the 13th
    century the noble families and upper middle-class merchants who controlled
    the free town built many fortified tower houses (probably 72) as symbols of
    their wealth and power. 

    But the fame of this stunning place in the Senese countryside derives from
    more than just its artistic and architectural gems. Tasting the Vernaccia di
    San Gimignano is an absolute must. This exquisite white wine is produced
    only in these hills. It is said that vineyards were introduced to this area
    for the first time around the year 1200. The Vernaccia was the first Tuscan
    white wine to earn the DOC, Guarantee of Origin (in 1993), and it has been
    the object of a constant evolution, both in the vineyard and in the cellar. 


    This stunning area of Tuscany is also famous for its mouth-watering
    truffles, excellent extra-virgin Olive Oil and for the delicious red wines,
    such as the famous Brunello di Montalcino. During our gourmet tour together
    we will discover all the wonders of this enchanting area and everything
    about the production methods of these unique products. Of course we will
    taste them in fantastic tasting of a thousand and one night!
