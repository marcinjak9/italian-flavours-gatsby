    I graduated in Italian Literature and I attained a Master degree in Gourmet
    and Quality Food at the renowned University of Florence, where I had the
    chance to deepen my knowledge about the history of Italian gourmet culture
    products. 


    I collaborated with the Tourist Board of Oristano, where I live and I worked
    as a senior quality consultant for 10 years. After many years working in the
    field, I decided to put these experiences to use and I founded my first own
    company, Sardinia Flavour, which aim was to make people all over the world
    know and taste the most precious and traditional delicacies from Italy.
