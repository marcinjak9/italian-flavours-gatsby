    Piedmont - which translates roughly in English as ‘foot of the mountain’ -
    is known in Italy as the land of mountains. Surrounded by the highest
    Italian peaks and set within the Alps, Piedmont offers incredibly beautiful
    landscapes to its visitors. Landscapes that form a backdrop of sweeping,
    picturesque valleys and characterise this welcoming part of the “Bella
    Italia”.


    But nature is just one of the many attractions of Piedmont, a region rich in
    typical DOP and IGP products (this is a brand awarded by UE for a high level
    of quality, for strong connection to their original territory and for
    traditional and unique production methods). Cheeses like Bra, Gorgonzola and
    Grana Padano as well as the “Doja” salami  (which is covered with melted
    lard and derives its name from the container in which it is prepared, a
    terracotta basket called “doja”) are just some of the delicacies you will
    taste during this tour.


    The landscapes of Langhe and Monferrato are full of cultivated hills and
    vineyards blessed with small towns and castles. Expanses of water and rice
    paddies, long rows of poplar trees and old farmhouses are all parts of the
    typical scenery of the Piedmont area. Thanks to the incredible variety and
    beauty of the composition of its soil, Piedmont is perfectly suited for the
    production of wines such as Barolo, Dolcetto, Barbera, Barbaresco, Moscato
    and Pinot. These are only a few of the delicious wines which have this
    extraordinary region as their origin, in fact there are more that 100 of
    them! 


    Together we will have some of the most remarkable wine experiences and of
    course you will also have the chance to taste the “Asti spumante DOCG”, one
    of the most famous Italian sparkling wines.

    And do not forget truffles! Of course, we cannot leave Piedmont without
    having participated in an exciting truffle hunt and without having tasted
    them! It will be a feast of flavours, colours, scents and beautiful views. I
    can guarantee you will fall in love with Piedmont!
