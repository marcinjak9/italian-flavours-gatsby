I work closely with you to create a made-to-order travel experience of a lifetime, optimized to make sure you get the most out of every moment, so that when the time comes to book your next holiday, I know what your preferences and desires are and I am ready to provide a personal, one-on-one, dedicated service. 

# What kind of experience in Italy are you dreaming of?

**Culinary Small Group Tour  **           

Count on intimate group sizes of no more than 18 guests, stay in only the finest hotels and experience unmatched insider access to revered sites, often before the crowds arrive. Backed by the support and expertise of over 55 offices in more than 30 countries, you also travel under the wing of A&K's award-winning Resident Tour Directors®, who bring your destination to life with one-of-a-kind local insight.

Our unmatched service, local knowledge and painstaking attention to detail are an award-winning combination that has earned us praise from both travellers and travel professionals, who for more than a decade have consistently chosen A&K as the world's finest luxury travel company.

When you travel with A&K, you enjoy unrivaled insider access to the authentic heart and soul of a place — and to people and sites that lie far beyond the reach of the average traveller. Our longstanding relationships in every destination we visit make it all possible, from the seamless flow of an A&K itinerary to the prompt attention paid to an unanticipated request. This trustworthy, on-the-ground presence also allows us to manage your safety and security, which are always our first priorities.

Every journey we offer has been designed by on-the-ground experts who know each destination intimately. Our ideal small group size and unrivaled insider access allow them to create itineraries that feature iconic destinations experienced at the perfect pace. You enjoy the benefits, including extra time on safari, longer stops in places you most want to see and even multiple stops, such as viewing the Taj Mahal at both sunrise and sunset.

Your A&K Resident Tour Director brings your itinerary to life through decades of firsthand experience in your destination, sharing insights into the culture that can only come from someone who is, in fact, a local. Overseeing your entire journey and accompanying you every day, he or she reveals the real spirit of a place, connecting you to the people, places and wildlife you encounter in a way you’ll never forget.

Our Luxury Small Group Journeys are limited to just 18 like-minded guests — seasoned travellers who bring their own unique perspectives to your journey — allowing us to reserve hotels that can’t accommodate the typically larger (40-plus) groups that travel with other companies. This also opens up a world of exclusive insider-access opportunities, while affording you more time to interact with your Resident Tour Director.
