Setting the standard for luxury small-group travel worldwide, Abercrombie & Kent's Luxury Small Group Journeys deliver the best in comfort and service in the world's greatest destinations.

allows you to experience A&K’s hallmark blend of insider access and style in more than 100 countries around the world, on an itinerary created for you and your family or friends. From arrival to departure, every detail is anticipated and every effort made to ensure a seamless, unforgettable travel experience. With A&K, you walk right in where others wait in line, visit world-famous sites before they open to the public and experience authentic local interactions beyond the scope of any guidebook.



Your hand-picked, English-speaking A&K local guides join you at each step on your Luxury Tailor Made Journey, bringing your destination to life through authentic, beyond-the-guidebook knowledge.



Every traveler is different — and so is every Luxury Tailor Made Journey. We consider what you want to do and how you like to travel, and then put that knowledge to work to make a journey uniquely yours.



Create a journey based on one of these themes, mix and match them or make up your own for a journey that’s just right for you.



Browse a market and prepare lunch with a local chef, or dine with a local family in their home for a taste of authentic hospitality.

When it comes to art and architecture, some travellers can’t get enough. Luxury Tailor Made Journeys connect you with local artists for private visits to their studios, or with collectors who take you on a guided tour of their favorite galleries.
