I graduated in Italian Literature and I attained a **Master degree in Gourmet and Quality Food** at the renowned University of Florence, where I had the chance to deepen my knowledge about the history of Italian gourmet culture products.

I collaborated with the Tourist Board of Oristano, where I live and I worked as a senior quality consultant for 10 years. After many years working in the field, I decided to put these experiences to use and I founded my first own company, Sardinia Flavour, which aim was to make people all over the world know and taste the most precious and traditional delicacies from Italy.

The inspirational experience with Sardinia Flavour allowed me to get in touch with the most antique food traditions and the best Italian food artisans, as well as the best Italian wineries and gourmet restaurants, a network of little precious jewels, the ones you are going to visit during the unique tours I create every year.

My mission is to give my little contribution to preserve small artisan producers and all those gourmet and cultural Italian peculiarities offering travel experiences off the beaten track, far from touristic places and restaurants, however promoting the knowledge of Italian authenticities, letting people directly experience, smell and taste the real perfumes, flavours and colours of Italian regional culture and the most gorgeous hidden secrets of Italian artistic heritage.

My clients are mainly from UK, North-Est Europe and above all Australia. My passion in sharing the beauty and uniqueness of the authentic Italian Gourmet Culture has given me the chance to build strong and meaningful relationships with them. Most of my clients have been traveling with me for years, enjoying the relaxing atmosphere of lovely boutique hotels and agriturismi, funny cooking classes, which some of them I lead personally, mouth-watering wine and food tastings and knowing the most authentic soul of Italy and, at the end, becoming more than simple clients for me, but “cari amici” (dear friends)
