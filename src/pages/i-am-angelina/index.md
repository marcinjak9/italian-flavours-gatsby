Are you dreaming of an exclusive, tailor-made** food & wine journey **in the most charming and genuine parts of Italy? An unforgettable holiday made up of authentic and **deeply immersive** experiences that will give you insider-access to local life and the oldest traditions of _Bella Italia_?

You are definitely in the right place, and I couldn't be more happy!

I am sure you are now curious to know something more about me. Here is my story:

I am Angelina, I am Sardinian and I have been head-over-heels in love with Italian gourmet traditions since I was a little child. I always felt my mission was to dedicate my life to **sharing the beauty** and uniqueness of Italian food & wine culture.

I was born in a cosy house a stone's throw from the romantic shores of Lake Como, were I spent my childhood, breathing in the calmness and the magic of that stunning place. 

I was still a little girl when my parents, who were born in Sardinia, decided it was time to go back to the Island, so I started making Sardinian handmade pasta and sweets very early!

My life has flowed very fast since then, spending perfumed summers in the **family **olive groves and vineyards, waiting for the best wind to harvest the olives, making wine with _nonno_ and preserving delicious sun-dried tomatoes with _nonna_.

I graduated in Italian Literature and I attained a **Masters degree in Gourmet and Quality Food** at the renowned **University of Florence**, where I had the chance to deepen my knowledge about the story and the quality of Italian gourmet food products.

I collaborated with the Tourist Board of my city, Oristano, and I worked as a senior quality consultant for 10 years. After many years working in the field, I decided to put these experiences to use and I founded my first company, Sardinia Flavour, with the aim of making people all over the world know and taste the most precious and traditional delicacies of my beloved Italy.

The inspirational experience with Sardinia Flavour allowed me to get in touch with the best Italian food artisans, who pass down the generations old and fascinating food traditions, as well as the leading Italian wineries and gourmet restaurants, allowing me to create **a network of precious jewels**. These same locations will be the ones you are going to visit during the exclusive travel experiences I create every year with **Italian Flavours**.

My mission now is to give my little contribution to **preserve small artisan producers** and all those unique gourmet and cultural Italian specialities, offering travel adventures **off-the-beaten-track**, far from touristic places and restaurants. In this way I work to promote the knowledge of Italian authenticities, letting people directly experience, smell and taste the real perfumes, flavours and colours of Italian regional culture, and the most gorgeous, hidden secrets of Italian artistic heritage, all of this in outstanding "life-changing" **gourmet safaris**.

My passion in sharing the beauty and unique nature of** Italian cultural heritage** has given me the chance to build strong and meaningful relationships with my guests. Most of them have been travelling with me for years, enjoying the relaxing atmosphere of lovely **boutique hotels** and _agriturismi_, funny cooking classes (some of which I lead personally) and mouth-watering wine and food tastings. With me, my guests come to know the most authentic **soul of Italy **and, at the end, we become not just tour-guide and tourist, but _cari amici_.

Oh, wait...I am a passionate globe-trotter too! I am always interested in discovering new cultures and traditions. This has led me to visit half the world, but I still lack the other half...

So, are you ready to "taste" an **immersive travel experience in Italy, **to savour the authentic energy and distinctive flavours of **Italian local life**? Ready to participate in authentic, exclusive and engaging local interactions that will connect you to my beloved country in unexpected and unforgettable ways? 

**Contact me** and I will bring you where real gourmet Italian people go, to do things real Italians do, taste food real Italians eat, and drink wines real Italians drink!
